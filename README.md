# gyroled

This is the control code for a music-reactive gyroscopic LED totem I designed for EDC. I wrote a detailed blog post about it here: https://bencbartlett.com/blog/gyroscope-led-totem. It includes sub-libraries for beat detection, bluetooth control of the totem, performing kick-drum weighted FFTs, controlling servos, shaders for the rings, and a Python simulator for a nested many-ring system.
